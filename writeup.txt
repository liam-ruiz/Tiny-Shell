TESTING STRATEGY

<Replace with a detailed description of your testing strategy.>

file that 
null path 
current directory 
bunch of directory lengths 

are all error lines terminated by '\n'?

need to look at sig_xxx handlers more: what abt multiple of the same
signal (concurrently) or multiple different signals at the same time?

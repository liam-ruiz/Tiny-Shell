TESTING STRATEGY

1. Test a program that spawns a child process (to test that SIGINT and SIGTSTP
are properly sent to the enitre foreground group. (tests handlers))
2. Test bg/fg with non-integer string (eg "blah"), an int that isn't a valid 
pid/jid, and 0. (tests do_bgfg edgecases)
3. Tests something that should produce the "Command not found prompt" (ie when 
an invalid directory is given and when searching the path for an invalid 
command.)
4. Tests that sending multiple signals (ie SIGTSTP and SIGINT do not interfere, 
so that only one acts on the foreground group.)
5. Tests an empty command line.
6. Tests each of the ways the current directory can be a part of the path (ie 
is an empty string, starts or ends with :, or 2 :'s in a row.)
7. Tests when path = NULL
8. Tests something like "myspin 6" as opposed to "./myspin 6" when the current 
directory is and isn't included in the path. (Correctly identifies when current
directory is in the path)
9. Test that path is correctly ordered (ie if there are 2 programs that are 
valid from the path, the one that occurs first in the path is the one that is 
run)

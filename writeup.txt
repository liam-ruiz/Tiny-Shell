TESTING STRATEGY

<Replace with a detailed description of your testing strategy.>

null path 
current directory 
bunch of directory lengths 

are all error lines terminated by '\n'?

need to look at sig_xxx handlers more: what abt multiple of the same
signal (concurrently) or multiple different signals at the same time?

testcase on bg/fg? 
exit out of child process when execv fails b/c no path exists (test case)

"When you implement your signal handlers, be sure to send SIGINT and 
SIGTSTP signals to the entire foreground process group, , using “-pid” instead 
of “pid” in the argument to the kill function.The sdriver.pl program tests for 
this error" - Do we handle this?

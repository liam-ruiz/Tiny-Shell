A simple shell implementation (tsh.c) that implements the following built-in commands:
– The quit command terminates the shell.
– The jobs command lists the stopped jobs and running background jobs.
– The bg <job> command restarts <job> by sending it a SIGCONT signal, and then runs it in
the background. The <job> argument can be either a PID or a JID. (Which can be seen by running the jobs command)
– The fg <job> command restarts <job> by sending it a SIGCONT signal, and then runs it in
the foreground. The <job> argument can be either a PID or a JID.


Additionally, the shell can run other programs by supplying a path and arguments, just like a normal shell. There are some 
accompanying simple programs to run the shell with.
